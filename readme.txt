[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy) is a service that pull comments, likes, and reshares on social networks back to your web site. You can also use it to post to social networks - or comment, like, reshare, or even RSVP - from your own web site.

== Description == 

This plugin is a user interface for the Bridgy service and requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin to 
notify Bridgy to post. 

It also stores a link to the syndicated version for display by [Syndication Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/) 
or other uses.

[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy) posts to social networks by reading the HTML of your site. This means that the post is generates depends on your 
theme and any content generated by plugin. Bridgy offers a preview mode on their site to test your theme. 

Critical Bugs only due its deprecation for the plugin only should be submitted through [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/bridgy-publish).
